#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
    Software engineering is a disciplined approach to designing, developing, testing, deploying and maintaining software applications.
    It ensures that the final product is reliable, scalable, maintainable, and efficient with use of engineering principles.
     Importance:
    1.It ensures high quality software.
    2.It reduces cost and time of software development.
    3.It increases software efficiency and productivity.
    4.Ensures reliability and security.
    5It enhnces scalability and maintainability. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
    1980's: Object Oriented Programming(OOP)
        OOP became popular with languages like c++, and SmallTalk improving software modularity and reusability.
        Software quality and maintenance became major leading to better development practices.
    
    1990's: Agile Methods and INternet
        -Web applications and open source software (Linux,Java) transformed development
        -the Agile manifesto (2001) introduced flexible, iterative development methods.

    200's to present: Cloud, AI, and DevOps
        -cloud Computing(AWS, Azure) enabled scalable and distributed applications.
        -DevOps and CI/CD automated software applications deployment and maintenance.
        -AI, Blockchain, and microservices reshaped modern software architecture.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    1.Planning-Define project goals, scope, budget, and feasibility.
    2.Requirement analysis - Gather and document user needs and system requirements.
    3.Design - Create software architectures, UI, UX, and database structures.
    4.Implementation - Write code, test, and integrate components.
    5.Testing - Validate software functionality and performance.
    6.Deployment - Release software to production environment.
    7.Maintenance - Monitor, update, and maintain software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
    Differences:
    1.Project Structure
        -Waterfall follows a linear step by step process; each phase(planning, requirement analysis, designing, implementing, testing, deploying, and maintaining),  must be completed before going to the next.
        -Agile is incremental an iterative; development happens in small cycles(sprints), allowing future updates and refinements.
    
    2.Flexibility and Adaptability
        -Waterfall is rigid and inflexible; once a phase is completed, it is difficult to change, changes are also difficult and expensive
        -Agile is flexible and adaptable; allows for changes and updates throughout the development process.

    3.Testing Process
        -Waterfall testing happens at the end of the development process
        -Agile testing happens throughout the development process.

    4.Time and cost efficiency
        -Waterfall is time-consuming and expensive
        -Agile is time-efficient and cost-effective.

    Examples of appropriate scenarios:
    1.Waterfall Methodology
        -Banking System Development – Regulations require strict planning and minimal changes.
        -Planning Software – Fixed requirements ensure proper alignment with regulations
        -Projects with a fixed budget and timeline
    2.Agile Methodology
        -E-Commerce website - Needs frequent updates based on user behaviors and market trends.
        -Game development - Features are tested and improved based on player feedback.
        -Projects with rapidly changing requirements or uncertain timelines.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
    Software Developer:
        -writes, tests and maintains code.
        -translates requirements into functional software.
        -debugsd and optimizes performance.
        -works with databases, APIs and frameworks.

    Quality Assurance Engineer:
        -ensures software meets quality standards.
        -writes and executes test cases(manual and automated).
        -identifies and reports bugs.
        -verifies usability, performance and security.

    Product Manager:
        -defines the product's visione and strategy.
        -works with stakeholders to gather requirements.
        -prioritizes  features and manages product road map.
        -bridges communication between developers, designers, and business teams.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
    Integrated Software Development:
        -Provides tools for coding, debugging, testing, and compiling in one place.
        -Improve productivity with features like:syntax highlighting, auto completion and error detection.
        -Examples: Visual Studio Code -  a light-weight, feature-rich IDE supporting multiple languages.

    Version Control Systems:
        =Track changes, allowing developers to collaborate and revert to previous versions if needed .
        -Prevents code conflicts in teams and ensures a history of modifications.
        -Examples: Git -  ai widely used distributed VCS, often paired with Github or Gitlab for collaborations.

    Both VCS and IDEs enhance development efficiency, organization and team work. 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
    1.Tight deadlines and High workload
        >Solution: Use agile methodologies, prioritize tasks, and automate repetitive processes.
    2.Balancing Performance and Functionality 
        >Solution: Optimize code, use caching, and implement efficient algorithms.
    3.Keeping up With new Technologies
        >Solution: Continuous learning through online courses, coding challenges, and community engagement
    4.Communication and Collaboration Issues
        >Solution: Use tools like Slack, Jira,or Trello and encourage regular team meetings.
    5.Debugging and fixing Bugs:
    >Solution: Use debugging tools, write unit tests, perform regular testing and implement a systematic approach to bug fixing
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
   1.Unit Testing

        Tests individual components (functions, classes) to ensure they work correctly.
        Importance: Catches bugs early and improves code reliability.
   
    2.Integration Testing

        Tests interactions between different modules or components.
        Importance: Ensures seamless communication between system parts.
    
    3.System Testing

        Tests the entire application as a whole.
        Importance: Verifies that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

    4.Acceptance Testing

        Determines if the software meets business requirements and is ready for release.
        Importance: Ensures customer satisfaction and usability.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
    Definittion:
        Prompt Engineering is the practice of designing and refining input queries (prompts) to efficiently interact with AI models and get accurate,useful and relevant responses.
        Importance: 
        Improves the quality of AI responses, reduces ambiguity, and enables more effective communication between

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
    Example of a Vague Prompt:
        "Tell me about cars."

    Improved Prompt:
        "Explain the differences between electric and gasoline cars, including their costs, environmental impact, and maintenance needs."

    Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective:
        More Specific – Focuses on a comparison of electric vs. gasoline cars rather than all cars in general.
        Clear Expectations – Specifies key aspects: costs, environmental impact, and maintenance.
        Concise & Direct – Avoids unnecessary words while keeping the request precise.
